Apache Fineract

REQUIREMENTS
============
* `Java >= 17` (Azul Zulu JVM is tested by our CI on GitHub Actions)
* MariaDB `10.9`


INSTRUCTIONS: How to run using Docker and docker-compose
===================================================

It is possible to do a 'one-touch' installation of Fineract using containers (AKA "Docker").
Fineract now packs the mifos community-app web UI in it's docker deploy.
You can now run and test fineract with a GUI directly from the combined docker builds.
This includes the database running in a container.

As Prerequisites, you must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your machine; see
[Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and
[Docker Compose Install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Alternatively, you can also use [Podman](https://github.com/containers/libpod)
(e.g. via `dnf install podman-docker`), and [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose/)
(e.g. via `pip3 install podman-compose`) instead of Docker.

Now to run a new Fineract instance you can simply:

1. `git clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git ; cd fineract`
1. for windows, use `git clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git --config core.autocrlf=input ; cd fineract`
1. `./gradlew :fineract-provider:jibDockerBuild -x test`
1. `docker-compose up -d`
1. fineract (back-end) is running at https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/
1. wait for https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/actuator/health to return `{"status":"UP"}`
1. you must go to https://localhost:8443 and remember to accept the self-signed SSL certificate of the API once in your browser, otherwise  you get a message that is rather misleading from the UI.
1. community-app (UI) is running at http://localhost:9090/?baseApiUrl=https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider&tenantIdentifier=default
1. login using default _username_ `mifos` and _password_ `password`

https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract has a pre-built container image of this project, built continuously.

You must specify the MySQL tenants database JDBC URL by passing it to the `fineract` container via environment
variables; please consult the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) for exact details how to specify those.
_(Note that in previous versions, the `mysqlserver` environment variable used at `docker build` time instead of at
`docker run` time did something similar; this has changed in [FINERACT-773](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-773)),
and the `mysqlserver` environment variable is now no longer supported.)_


INSTRUCTIONS: How to execute Integration Tests
============
The easiest way to execute integration tests is by following this wiki: 
https://fineract-academy.com/how-to-run-fineract-integration-test-with-intellij-idea.html

THE REST OF THIS README IS NOT REQUIRED FOR THE TAKE HOME ASSESSMENT.
============
But feel free to read if you so desire. You can also visit the original ReadMe [here](https://github.com/apache/fineract?tab=readme-ov-file#apache-fineract-a-platform-for-microfinance) 


Checkstyle and Spotless
============

This project enforces its code conventions using [checkstyle.xml](config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml) through Checkstyle and [fineract-formatting-preferences.xml](config/fineract-formatting-preferences.xml) through Spotless. They are configured to run automatically during the normal Gradle build, and fail if there are any violations detected. You can run the following command to automatically fix spotless violations:

    `./gradlew spotlessApply`

Since some checks are present in both Checkstyle and Spotless, the same command can help you fix some of the Checkstyle violations (but not all, other Checkstyle violations need to fixed manually).

You can also check for Spotless violations (only; but normally don't have to, because the regular build full already includes this anyway):

    `./gradlew spotlessCheck`

We recommend that you configure your favourite Java IDE to match those conventions. For Eclipse, you can go to
Window > Java > Code Style and import our [config/fineractdev-formatter.xml](config/fineractdev-formatter.xml) under formatter section and [config/fineractdev-cleanup.xml](config/fineractdev-cleanup.xml) under Clean up section. The same fineractdev-formatter.xml configuration file (that can be used in Eclipse IDE) is also used by Spotless to both check for violations and autoformat code on the CLI.
You could also use Checkstyle directly in your IDE (but you don't neccesarily have to, it may just be more convenient for you).  For Eclipse, use https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/ and load our checkstyle.xml into it, for IntelliJ you can use [CheckStyle-IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea).

<br><br>APACHE FINERACT PLATFORM API
============

The API for Fineract is documented in [apiLive.htm](fineract-provider/src/main/resources/static/api-docs/apiLive.htm), and the [apiLive.htm can be viewed on Fineract.dev](https://fineract.apache.org/legacy-docs/apiLive.htm "API Documentation").  If you have your own Fineract instance running, you can find this documentation under [/fineract-provider/api-docs/apiLive.htm](https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/api-docs/apiLive.htm).

The Swagger documentation (work in progress; see [FINERACT-733](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-733)) can be accessed under [/fineract-provider/swagger-ui/index.html](https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/swagger-ui/index.html) and [live Swagger UI here on Fineract.dev](https://demo.fineract.dev/fineract-provider/swagger-ui/index.html).

Apache Fineract supports client code generation using [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) based on the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).  For more instructions on how to generate the client code, check [docs/developers/swagger/client.md](docs/developers/swagger/client.md).

<br>ERROR HANDLING GUIDELINES
------------------
* When catching exceptions, either rethrow them, or log them.  Either way, include the root cause by using `catch (SomeException e)` and then either `throw AnotherException("..details..", e)` or `LOG.error("...context...", e)`.
* Completely empty catch blocks are VERY suspicous!  Are you sure that you want to just "swallow" an exception?  Really, 100% totally absolutely sure?? ;-) Such "normal exceptions which just happen sometimes but are actually not really errors" are almost always a bad idea, can be a performance issue, and typically are an indication of another problem - e.g. the use of a wrong API which throws an Exception for an expected condition, when really you would want to use another API that instead returns something empty or optional.
* In tests, you'll typically never catch exceptions, but just propagate them, with `@Test void testXYZ() throws SomeException, AnotherException`..., so that the test fails if the exception happens.  Unless you actually really want to test for the occurence of a problem - in that case, use [JUnit's Assert.assertThrows()](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Exception-testing) (but not `@Test(expected = SomeException.class)`).
* Never catch `NullPointerException` & Co.
